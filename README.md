# ACL-TCAM-Analyser
Script to determine the TCAM resources required for a given access-list on the Cisco 8000 series platforms.
Script currently only supports IPv4 ACLs. 
No support for hybrid ACLs with object groups.
To use the script create a file in the same folder as the script called "sample-acl" and copy your ACL into that file. Then run the script.
